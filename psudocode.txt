done 1. Get triangle corners
    - store points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)
done 2. get the amount of points wanted

donw -3. in a for loop lopping for (step 2) times
    done-start point 
    done -Pick a random vertex of the triangle
    done -Find midpoint between current point and chosen vertex
    done -Add midpoint to list of points
    done -Make midpoint the new current point


done -4. Draw everything
    -Plot all points as tiny dots
    -In small line draw the out side of triangle
