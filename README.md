# Sierpinskis-triangle
What happens if you take pure randomness… and end up with perfect order?
That’s the coolness behind Sierpiński’s Triangle, a fractal that emerges from Chaos.

In my project, I built an algorithm that starts with one simple piece of info: a side length. From there, a single point “jumps” halfway toward one of the vertices at random. Repeat this process thousands of times, and instead of a scattered mess, a beautiful triangular fractal begins to appear—layer by layer.
-Infinite detail, no matter how far you zoom.
-Chaos that somehow organizes itself into structure.
-A project that’s math, art, and computer science.
